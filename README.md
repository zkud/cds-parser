## Overview

The ```open-cds-ast``` crate was designed as the foundation for any tooling for SAP CAP CDS, which needs to work with the language
and do it efficiently. The crate itself is robustly inspired by a pretty famous project ESTree for JavaScript, which lays
under the hood of eslint and other similar tooling.

Try to implement your own handy tooling for CAP CDS :)

## Usage

To get started add this to your ```Cargo.toml```:
```
open_cds_ast="0.0.1"
```
